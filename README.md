A new game in carrom-board called Clean Strike is played by 2 players with multiple turns. A turn has a player attempting to strike a coin with the striker. Players alternate in taking turns.

## The game is described as follows:

There are 9 black coins, a red coin and a striker on the carrom-board 
Strike - When a player pockets a coin he/she wins a point . <br />
Multi-strike - When a player pockets more than one coin he/she wins 2 points. All, but 2 coins, that were pocketed, get back on to the carrom-board . <br />
Red strike - When a player pockets red coin he/she wins 3 points. If other coins are  pocketed along with red coin in the same turn, other coins get back on to the carrom-board . <br />
Striker strike - When a player pockets the striker he/she loses a point . <br />
Defunct coin - When a coin is thrown out of the carrom-board, due to a strike, the player loses 2 points, and the coin goes out of play . <br />
When a player does not pocket a coin for 3 successive turns he/she loses a point . <br />
When a player fouls 3 times (a foul is a turn where a player loses, at least, 1 point), he/she loses an additional point . <br />
A game is won by the first player to have won at least 5 points, in total, and, at least, 3 points more than the opponent . <br />
When the coins are exhausted on the board, if the highest scorer is not leading by, at least, 3 points or does not have a minimum of 5 points, the game is considered a draw . <br />
Write a program that takes in the outcome of each turn as input and outputs the result of the game as and when applicable along with necessary statistics that supports the result . <br />
